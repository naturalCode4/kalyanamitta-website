People sometimes about my 'spiritual awakening' (or whatever you want to call it), and I can't put a finger on it! My growth feels rather continuous my whole life and whatever I was doing before that. When I started to spontaneously experience what Tibetan Buddhists call the early stages of 'Dzogchen' at the age of 15, it felt just right: Ah yes of course. I've learned a tremendous amount through Buddhism, Kabbalah, Christian Mysticism, Taoism, Modern Spiritualities and Modalities, and being a human in general. You could say I am polyamorous with the many spiritual traditions and practices of the world. But most of all I learn to trust inner guidance and Great Spirit.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Kalyāņa Mitta means Wise Friendship in Pali, the language the historical Shakyamuni Buddha spoke. I strive to be a true friend – one who benefits others’ lives via one’s own realization, wisdom, compassion, and virtue. I am determined to be part of the collective healing and awakening, offering the knowledge, love, and virtue that I have. My goal is to make my livelihood with deep integrity by doing what I actually love and feel most called to do: helping you: supporting the lives of all beings. I have a tremendous amount to learn and we are on this journey together. Thank you Great Spirit, my teachers, friends, and all the traditions I have learned from.\n\n              </p>\n  \n              <Link to=\"/about\" className=\"btn\">Learn More</Link>\n
