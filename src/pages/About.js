              <h2>About Adin</h2>
              <p>
                When I was 15, I rapidly shifted from being quite depressed to undergoing a radical expansion in consciousness and access to peace and happiness. It was as if my sense of self deeply quieted, replaced by a very peaceful and ecstatic presence. When this opened up, it felt like a natural continuation of who I'd always been. I remember in elementary school preferring to lay in the grass watching the clouds rather than hang out with friends, and I remember spending hours wandering through my neighborhood in deep play—a state that's so vital for children to experience. I navigated this blissful state and discovered I could dissolve negative emotions in 60-90 seconds simply by allowing them to be. Around that time, I encountered a neat little book called The Teachings of Buddha, and it immediately read like poetry pointing to the truths of consciousness, our kind and pure nature, and our potential.

              <p>
                After about six months of this, I struggled to integrate this experience with the rest of my human experience. With little cultural context or appreciation for what I was going through and the insights that were arising, I felt confused. I also had unresolved painful emotions and trauma that, with the greater awareness now present in me, could finally become conscious. I'd formed a dualistic illusion that the expansive state I'd experienced was more "real" than any other experience, which resulted in a lot of judgment and agitation toward other parts of myself. While these states may carry a higher truth frequency, we ought to bring our entire integrated being into life. During this time, I immersed myself in Ram Dass's Be Here Now, reading it over and over—it had a profound impact on me. It took time to integrate these expanded aspects of consciousness with my human and interpersonal self. And working through pain from early childhood experiences is surely an ongoing journey—I'm still doing it—and I can help you do it too.

                At Wesleyan University, I explored Zen Buddhist meditation, Ashtanga Yoga, and eagerly pursued a more truthful knowing of the heart and mind while studying music and engineering. My friends and I were concerned about the stress and mental-performance-focused culture we saw both on campus and in society at large. We founded the Wesleyan Buddhist meditation club and created a really supportive space together. A friend who had spent a semester at Dai Bosatsu Zendo brought our group there, where I got to experience meditation in a beautiful, traditional context.
              </p> 
              <p>
                Since then, I've continued to practice in Zen Buddhism while expanding into Theravadan and Tibetan Buddhism. I've explored somatic practices, medicine work, shamanism, several healing arts, psychic development, EFT, yoga and bhakti, mysticism across Judaic, Christian, Sufi, and Taoist traditions, sound healing, and ecstatic dance—seeking what genuinely gives life, unclouds a pure heart, and supports transformation.

                In April 2025, it occurred to me that I was ready to center my livelihood around what I already love and genuinely want to do—helping people. To be fair, I wasn't fully ready before then. Once I made a confident commitment to step into this work, Spirit sent me on quite a healing journey, which I believe purified me and prepared me to step more fully into service. This year I certified in Reiki II, EFT, yoga, and pranayama. Now I feel aligned, grounded, and ready to offer this work from a place of depth.

                A Note on Teachers and Practice
              </p>
              <p>
                I have deep respect for teachers who embody the great depths of practice and actualization. Those who have guided me in my spiritual development, particularly in meditation and healing arts, are more experienced and mature than I am (though we need not cling to hierarchies of advancement—we are all equal in our essential nature). I don't claim to match their capacity for spiritual transmission. If you have a profound longing for awakening, I can help you find an excellent practice community and/or teacher, and I'll remain a friend and support on your path. I'm not an NBA star, so I can't train you to be an NBA star. We can generally guide others to the degree of our own realization. Much gratitude and love to everyone who has supported me or taught me anything worth teaching

                "I recently booked a Reiki session with Adin, who I have known for sometime through our shared interest in Yoga. I had done Reiki only once with a different practitioner, and came away as a bit of a skeptic; I didn't feel any different at the end of the session. My experience with Adin was very different. He has a very simple and straightforward way of speaking and explaining the Reiki process, which put me at ease very quickly.  We talked for a few minutes then he began the Reiki process.  Adin has a wonderful aura about him of contained energy and confidence, with a feeling of intuitively moving and allowing the energy to move, of becoming the 'Hollow Bone' that the ancient healers speak off.  I felt the energy within my body and mind, and came away from the session with a wonderful sense of energized peace and well-being that stayed with me for several days. I wholeheartedly recommend him as a naturally gifted Reiki practitioner, and look forward to doing more energy healing work with him soon.
